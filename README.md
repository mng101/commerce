# Project 2 - Commerce

Web Programming with Python and Javascript

This project builds an eBay-like eCommerce auction site that will allow users to post auction
listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a "watchlist"

Demonstration steps in the Project Video

Unauthenticated user:

    The user can only view the Index Page and the Listing Detail Page. Users can register for
    access to the website, and use the registered Username and Passowrd to login

Authenticated User:

    Authenticated users are presented with additonal menu options on the Index page, along 
    with a list of active listings.
    Selecting a listing title presents the Listing Details page
    If the listing is the users own listing, they can update the listing if there are no 
    bids posted. The User can also Close the Auction, which makes the highest bidder the
    winner of the Auction.
    
    The user can Create a Listing using the menu option on the Index page.
    
    If the user selects a listing posted by another user, they can add the item to a
    "watchlist", post Comments on the Listing, and post a Bid.
    If the listing is on the users Watchlist, they can remove the Listing from the 
    Watchlist.
    When placing a Bid, the bid amounts must be $1.00 more than the Starting Bid, and the 
    Highest Bid, if any. Bids that do not confirm are rejected.
    
    Users can also post comments on Listings posted by other users.

Admin Access:

    The Site Administrator can view, add edit and delete any listing, comment, bids made
    on the site. The Administrator can also remove listings from a Users Watchlist.
